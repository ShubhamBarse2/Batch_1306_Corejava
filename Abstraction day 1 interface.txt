What is Abstraction in Java 

Abstraction is an OOP concept that hides implementation details and shows only essential(needed) features to the user.
 It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
Simple definition :
Abstraction means showing only important details and hiding internal implementation.


Why Do We Need Abstraction ?

To reduce complexity
To improve security
To achieve loose coupling
To make code easy to modify and maintain
To support real-world modeling


Real-life example:

ATM Machine → You see Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance
You don’t know the internal bank logic




How Abstraction Is Achieved in Java

Abstract Class
Interface




1> Interface : 

What is an Interface?
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class that is used to achieve 100% abstraction.
 It contains only abstract methods



Why Interface is Needed?

To achieve full abstraction
To support multiple inheritance
To define standard rules
To provide loose coupling
To design APIs and frameworks


Real-Time Example

USB Interface → Mouse, Keyboard, Printer
Payment Interface → PhonePe, GPay, Paytm
Bank Interface → SBI, HDFC, Axis



Syntax of Interface : 


interface InterfaceName {
    // variables
    // methods
}




All Variables - public static final
Methods - public abstract 



Interface : 

1> contains only abstract method
2> we cannot create object of interface 
3> interface cannot have Constructor 
4> we create reference of interface 
5> when we create any interface we need to give its implementation to other class 
6> at the time of implementation we used implements  
7> all variables should be public static final 
8> all abstract methods are public abstract 
9> we can achieved multiple inheritance through interface 




Interface extends interface 
class extends class
class implements interface
