OOPs : main piler Inheritance(IS-A Relationship) : 

Inheritance is an core concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
it is an approach where one class can acquired all the properties(V + M) of another class
Parent : super class
child : sub class 
it is an process where child(sub class) can acquired all the properties of parent(super class)
it is achieved by extends keywords  
inheritance is also called as IS-A Relational 

Example : 

Dog IS-A Animal 
Square IS-A Shapes 
Sonali IS-A Girls 
Apple IS-A Fruits 


note : inheritance is used to achieved Run Time Polymorphism(method Overriding)
       Reusability  




syntax : 


public class Parent {
 // V + M
}


public class Child extends Parent {

}








Example : 


Meta(P) : 

Register();
login();
logout();


Instagram(C) :
addStroy();
uploadReels();

FaceBook(C) :
addPost();
addComment(); 



MainClass :

we can create object of Child Classes and 
Access parent as well as child class Properties 



Example : 

Car(P) :

color;
model;
price;

  myEngine();
  myStering();


Bmw(C);
autoPark();

MgHector(C): 
 inbuildFunction();
