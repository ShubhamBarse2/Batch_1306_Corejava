Method Overriding :

Method Overriding is a feature of Java in which a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class, with the same method name and same parameters.
It is used to achieve Runtime Polymorphism.



Why We Need Method Overriding?
When parent class behavior is not sufficient and child class wants to change or specialize that behavior.
 Parent defines general behavior
 Child modifies specific behavior



Basic Syntax : 



class Parent {
    void methodName() {
        // parent implementation
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void methodName() {
        // child implementation
    }
}






Important Rules of Method Overriding :

Method name must be same
Parameters must be same
Return type must be same (or covariant return type)
Access modifier cannot be more restrictive
Only happens in inheritance
Cannot override :
final method
static method
private method
