Scanner is a predefined class in Java present in java.util package that is used to take input from the user. it provides inbuild methods to take any type input from user 


Using Scanner, we can take input of :

byte
short
int
float
double
String
boolean
long



Common Scanner Methods

Method	        Used For

nextInt()	Read integer
nextFloat()	Read float value
nextDouble()	Read double value
nextLong()	Read long value
next()	        Read single word
nextLine()	Read full line including spaces
nextBoolean()	Read true/false
nextByte()	Read byte
nextShort()	Read short



 Difference Between : next() vs nextLine()

 next()
Reads only one word
Stops at space

 nextLine()
Reads the entire line
Used for sentences

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // taking input
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        float marks = sc.nextFloat();

        sc.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        int c = a + b;

        System.out.println("Addition = " + c);
    }
}
