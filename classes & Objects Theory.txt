 
1. Introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
It allows developers to structure programs in a way that models real-world entities.
OOP focuses on :
Data (variables)
Behavior (functions/methods)


1. Class : 

A class is a blueprint, template, or layout that defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of an object.

You can think of a class as a design for creating multiple similar objects.
✔ Characteristics of a Class
It is a logical structure, not a physical entity.
It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
It can contain:
Variables (data members)(Fields)
Methods (member functions)


2. Object : 

An object is an instance of a class.
It is a real-world entity that has state (data) and behavior (methods).
✔ Characteristics of an Object
It occupies memory.
It represents something real: a student, car, laptop, employee, etc.
It is created from a class using the new keyword.



Object Creation :
 
 Syntax :

ClassName reference = new ClassName();


ex : Student s = new Student();

s → reference (stack)
new Student() → object (heap)

Reference variable created → stored in Stack memory
Object created using new → stored in Heap memory
Reference variable points to the object in heap.


Note : Key Points to Remember

A class is a design, an object is a real product.
Class does not occupy memory, object does.
Objects are created using the new keyword.
. dot operator is used to access object members.
Multiple objects can be created from one class.



Questions for Practise : 

set the values and print data : 

Q1. Create a class Laptop
Variables → brand, ram

Q2. Create a class Employee
Variables → id, name, salary

Q3. Create a class Car
Variables → model, price, color

Q4. Create a class Book
Variables → title, author, price










ref code of Object Creation : 


public class Car {

	String carColor;
	int modelYr;
	String carName;

	void carRunning() {
System.out.println("car is running ");
	}

	void carStaring() {
System.out.println("staring Activity");
	}

	void carWheels() {
System.out.println("Wheels are moving ");
	}

}










public class MainClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Car bmw = new Car();
		bmw.carRunning();
		bmw.carStaring();
		bmw.carWheels();

		System.out.println("---------------------");
		Car audi = new Car();
		audi.carRunning();
		audi.carStaring();
		audi.carWheels();

		System.out.println("---------------------");
		Car ssss = new Car();
		ssss.carRunning();
		ssss.carStaring();
		ssss.carWheels();

	}

}
