
Polymorphism in java : 

Meaning of Polymorphism
-> Polymorphism means “one task, many forms.”

in java : Same method name but Different  behavior 



Example (real-life):
A person is a teacher in college
A person is a father at home
A person is a customer in a shop

->  Same person, different roles.


Polymorphism is an OOP concept where:
One method or object behaves differently at different situations.



Types of Polymorphism in Java : 

Java supports two types of polymorphism :

Type	         Also Called	        Achieved Using

Compile-time	Static Polymorphism	Method Overloading
Run-time	Dynamic Polymorphism	Method Overriding


1> Method Overloading : 

What is Method Overloading?
When:
Same method name
Same class
Different parameters (number / type / order)
It is called Method Overloading.


Conditions for Method Overloading

At least one of these must change :
 Number of parameters
 Data type of parameters
 Order of parameters



Syntax for Method Overloading  : 

class ClassName {

    returnType methodName(parameters) {
        // code
    }

    returnType methodName(different parameters) {
        // code
    }
}


Example :
 

class Calculator {

    void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }

    void add(int a, int b, int c) {
        System.out.println(a + b + c);
    }

    void add(double a, double b) {
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}





Why Polymorphism is Required : 

Polymorphism helps to :
Achieve flexibility
Reduce code duplication
Support dynamic behavior
Improve maintainability
Implement real-time applications


Why it is Compile-Time Polymorphism?
Because method selection is done at compile time based on arguments.



Compile-time polymorphism means :

Method call is decided at compile time, not at runtime.
In Java, compile-time polymorphism is achieved using:
Method Overloading


Why it is called Compile-Time Polymorphism

Because:
The compiler decides which method to call
Decision is based on method parameters
Happens before program execution
